## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I started this project to practice my HTML/CSS skills that I have been learing for the past 2 months from Youtube videos and a few Udemy courses. This project helped me with learning how to structure my HTML in order to properly style the webpage/component with CSS.

I also decided to use SASS to practice my skills with the CSS preprocessor. Using it alongside Node.js and creating the package.json file to manage the dependencies for the project was helpful with practicing my development workflow skills.

### Continued development

The areas that I will continue to develop and work on are my HTML structure and my CSS/SASS styling skills to be able to quickly and more efficiently build and design web pages. This will help with developing my front end development skills.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://imagekit.io/blog/css-image-overlay/) - This article helped me with setting up my html and css to implement the overlay part of the project. Learning how to structure the html so that you can position the image overlay was very helpful.
- [Resource 2](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-into-a-div-container-using-css.php) - This article helped me figure out why my overlay image as not aligning at the bottom of the image. It was overflowing the main image because the main image had an additional 4px of height at the bottom of the image.
